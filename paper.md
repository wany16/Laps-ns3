I’m writing a paper titled “Latency Aware Packet Spraying on Unequal-cost Multi-path Data Center Networks” for a leading academic conference “SIGCOMM”. What I tried to say in the following section is “Algorithm design”. Unless otherwise specified or other requirements are brought up subsequently, this operation is executed on all subsequent inputs: Please translate the following Chinese into English and then rephrase it, or directly rephrase the following english, for clarity, coherence and conciseness, ensuring each paragraph flows into the next. Remove jargon. Use a professional tone. please rewrite as an professional computer networking researcher, using professional terms in DCN、load Balancing、congestion control. Making the reviewers tend to praise high on the writing and organization of the paper. 注意你的语言和用词必须确保都是有科学定义的，例如必须是计算机网络领域被 well-defined 有清晰科学/数学/网络定义，被广泛共识的词。避免使用模糊的、没有明确定义的或更偏向其他领域有科学规范的词。

After the flow's expected rate \( r1 \) and real-time rate \( r2 \) decrease to \( a \) and \( 0.5a \) respectively, and then increase continuously for \( N \) stages, the expected rate and real-time rate become very close. At this point, the rate increment per stage is only \( a/2^N \).
